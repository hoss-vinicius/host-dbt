This table is created through the field (custom_field_options) that belongs to the [ticket fields endpoint](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/).

We write into the table **cleaned_general.zendesk_custom_fields_issuer** using a databricks notebook **cleaned_zendesk** (git path: data_analytics_engineer/zendesk_scripts/cleaned_zendesk).
